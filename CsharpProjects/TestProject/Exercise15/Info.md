# Learning objectives

In this module, you'll practice how to:
Use Visual Studio Code to develop a C# console application that uses a combination of selection and iteration statements to implement logical workflows in accordance with supplied application data and user interactions.
Evaluate the underlying conditions and make an informed decision when choosing between if-elseif-else and switch statements, and between foreach, for, while, and do iteration statements.
Scope variables at an appropriate level within an application.

## Prerequisites

Experience using Visual Studio Code to develop, build, and run C# console applications that include console I/O and access the methods of .NET classes
Experience using C# code to evaluate conditional expressions and manage variable scope inside and outside of code blocks
Experience using if-elseif-else and switch-case statements in C# to match a variable or expression against several possible outcomes
Experience using foreach, for, do, and while statements in C# to loop through a block of code and access elements of array variables

### Exercise 1

In this exercise, you review the code in the Starter project, perform some code clean-up tasks, and then start adding features to your application. The tasks that you complete during this exercise are:

1. Code review: review the contents of the Program.cs file.
2. Sample data: convert the if-elseif-else structure to switch-case structure that improves readability.
3. Menu loop: enclose the main menu and menu item selection in a loop that iterates until the user enters "exit".
4. Menu selections: write the code for a switch-case structure that establishes separate code branches for each menu option.
5. Code branches: write placeholder within the menu item branches that provides user feedback until app features are developed.
6. Verification test: perform verification tests for the code that you develop in this exercise.
